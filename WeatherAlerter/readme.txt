A console application that calls OpenWeather API and then sends forecast data.

This application requires the following info added to the app.config file
	-email credentials to send messages from (was coded with gmail, note that gmail settings probably need to be tweaked to work)
	-openweather.org api key (free version)

Passed in as argument (or hardcoded in Program.cs if debug)
	-recipient email or cell phone number and carrier info (was coded with verizon cell phone as recipient)
